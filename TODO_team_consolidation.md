# Team Files Consolidation - COMPLETED ✅

## Consolidation Summary:
- ✅ **One Team.js file**: All components (TeamCard, SocialIcons) are integrated
- ✅ **One Team.css file**: Consolidated from Team.css and Team_new.css
- ✅ **Removed redundant files**: Team_new.css, TeamCard.js, SocialIcons.js

## Files Status:
- `src/components/Team/Team.js` - ✅ Main component (consolidated)
- `src/components/Team/Team.css` - ✅ Consolidated stylesheet
- `src/components/Team/Team_new.css` - ❌ Removed (redundant)
- `src/components/Team/TeamCard.js` - ❌ Removed (integrated in Team.js)
- `src/components/Team/SocialIcons.js` - ❌ Removed (integrated in Team.js)

## What was accomplished:
1. **CSS Consolidation**: Merged the best features from both Team.css and Team_new.css
   - Combined modern styling from Team_new.css
   - Preserved comprehensive features from Team.css (floating orbs, links section, etc.)
   - Maintained all responsive design features

2. **Component Consolidation**: The Team.js file already had all components integrated
   - TeamCard component is defined internally
   - SocialIcons component is defined internally
   - No import changes needed

3. **File Cleanup**: Removed all redundant files
   - Eliminated duplicate CSS file
   - Removed separate component files that were already integrated

## Result:
You now have exactly what you requested:
- **One Team.js file** with all functionality
- **One Team.css file** with consolidated styling
- **No extra files** - clean and organized

The team component should work exactly as before, but now with a cleaner file structure.
