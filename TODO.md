# TODO: Revamp Judging Criteria Section

## Step 1: Update Events.js ✅
- Add a thin divider or subtle gradient bar above the "Judging Criteria" heading.
- Enhance the judging criteria cards with framer-motion for smooth hover animations (shadow or gradient shift, no scaling).
- Add tooltips or "?" icons with fade-in explanations for each criterion.
- Ensure cards have glassy blurred dark backgrounds and soft colored border glows.

## Step 2: Update Events.css ✅
- Add styles for glassy blurred backgrounds (rgba(30,30,40,0.8)) with border-radius and drop shadows.
- Implement neon colored border glows (blue, teal, violet) on hover and active states.
- Update typography: criterion title (18-22px, soft semibold, white/light grey), percent (very bold, neon accent, ~2x title size).
- Add styles for tooltips with smooth fade-in and matching color palette.
- Add thin divider or subtle gradient bar above Judging Criteria heading.
- Ensure no clipping or overflow on hover/glow effects.
- Make grid layout responsive with generous spacing.

## Step 3: Testing and Verification ✅
- Test UI in different screen sizes for responsiveness.
- Verify hover animations and tooltip functionality.
- Confirm no layout glitches, clipping, or overflow issues.
- Ensure overall dark theme consistency (#191922 background).
